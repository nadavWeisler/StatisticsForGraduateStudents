OSF Data Codebook

Variables:
  * subject: subject ID number
  * block: task block number
  * trial: task trial number
  * cond: time constraint condition
      - ntc = no time constraint
      - tc = time constraint
  * timelimit: time limit for making a choice
  * frame: framing condition for the sure option
  * endow: endowment
  * prob: probability of winning gamble
  * sureOutcome: outcome displayed on the sure option
  * choice: which option was chosen
      - 1 = gamble
      - 0 = sure option
  * rt: response time in seconds
  * firstFix: first option that was fixated
  * fixBoth: whether both options were fixated before making a choice
      - 1 = fixated both gamble and sure option
      - 0 = fixated only one of the options
  * trialType: whether the trial was a target trial or catch
      - target = expected values of gamble and sure option are equivalent
      - catch_sure = expected value of the sure option is greater than
	the gamble
      - catch_gamble = expected value of the gamble is greater than the
	sure option
  * gainColor: shade of grey used to indicate gains
  * sureSide: side of the screen where the sure option was
    displayed
  

Notes:
  * Fixation data is NA for trials where the subject did not fixate
    either option or for trials/blocks/subjects that met our
    eye-tracking exclusion criteria (see manuscript and preregistration)
